# Reporting Guidelines

This guide contains orientation on how to report incidents in situations both online or in live events related to the Flutterando Community or associated. 

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct we ask that you report it to the Flutterando CoOrganizers by emailing [contato@flutterando.com.br](mailto:contato@flutterando.com.br). 

**All reports will be kept confidential.** 

In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need to be made. If that's the case, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

**If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate law enforcement first.** If you are unsure what law enforcement agency is appropriate, please include this in your report and we will attempt to notify them.

If you are unsure whether the incident is a violation, or whether the space where it happened is covered by this Code of Conduct, we encourage you to still report it. We would much rather have a few extra reports where we decide to take no action, rather than miss a report of an actual violation. We do not look negatively on you if we find the incident is not a violation. And knowing about incidents that are not violations, or happen outside our spaces, can also help us to improve the Code of Conduct or the processes surrounding it.

In your report please include:

- Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)
- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.
- When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
- Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger) please include a link.
- Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
- If you believe this incident is ongoing.
- Any other information you believe we should have.

### **What happens after you file a report?**

You will receive some form of contact, preferably through the platform where the report was sent, from one of the Flutterando coorganizers acknowledging receipt immediately. 
After that, your report will be brought to the coorganizers group, where we will immediately meet, if needed, to review the incident and determine:

- What happened.
- Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation.
- Who the bad actor was.
- Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to anyone's physical safety.

If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical safety, the working groups' immediate priority will be to protect everyone involved. This means we may delay an "official" response until we believe that the situation has ended and that everyone is physically safe.

Once the working group has a complete account of the events they will make a decision as to how to response. Responses may include:

- Nothing (if we determine no violation occurred).
- A private reprimand from the working group to the individual(s) involved.
- A public reprimand.
- An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from a Telegram channel).
- A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Flutterando spaces (Telegram, Discord, YouTube etc.)
- A request for a public or private apology.

We'll respond within two weeks to the person who filed the report with either a resolution or an explanation of why the situation is not yet resolved.

Once we've determined our final action, we'll contact the original reporter to let them know what action (if any) we'll be taking. We'll take into account feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of our response, but we don't guarantee we'll act on it.

Finally, the coorganizers may choose to do a public report of the incident.

### **What if your report concerns a possible violation by a committee member?**

If your report concerns a current member of the current board of coorganizers, you may not feel comfortable sending your report to the committee, as all members will see it.
 
In this case, please send your report directly to any one or all of our other coorganizers instead. You can find their contact in <a href='www.flutterando.com.br'>our website</a> or in our Discord.
They will follow the standard procedure but will exclude from any discussions or decisions the members which may be related to the incident reported. 

### **Reconsideration**

Any of the parties directly involved or affected can request reconsideration of the coorganizators' decision. To make such a request, contact the Flutterando Board at [contato@flutterando.com.br](mailto:contato@flutterando.com.br) with your request and motivation and the Flutterando board of coorganizers will review the case.
